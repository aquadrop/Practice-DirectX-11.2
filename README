PhysicsEngine-DirectX
=====================

DirectX 11.2 project displaying Multi-object, implementing Wind and Collision dynamics

--Phase 1 Demo is at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzv3FD8n6eM
  Phase 1 is about multiple objects rendering and simple rotation kinematics

--Phase 2 Demo is at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7vDq4AfXY
  Phase 2 is about texturing and complicated rotation kinematics, such as rotation in reference to another moving object.
  A solar system is rendered to demonstrate this functionality.

--Enjoy
